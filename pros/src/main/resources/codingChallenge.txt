Question 3: what are the key things you would consider when 
			creating/consuming an API to ensure that it is secure and reliable?
			
Solution 3 :
	
	While creating/consuming an API, I would ensure many things for security purposes.
	Few of them are as follows :
	
	a. I would take a serious care of authentication and authorization modules.
		It will allow me to secure the API from any invalid users and admins.
		Also, It will always check the credentials of users to authenticate them to use 
		my API.
		
	b. 	I will perform data validation in my API so that no one will be able to provide 
		invalid or wrong data and will always get a check message or error message while 
		passing the wrong data to the server. 
				Example :  "password should be atleast 6-8 characters"
	
	c. 	I will make sure that I'm passing the necessary information only and I would achieve 
		this by proper help of abstraction and encapsulation in Object oriented programming.
		
	d. 	By enabling Spring Security in my API using SecurityFilterChain	method and
		password encoders.
	
	e. By making sure that the data is possible encrypted and the sensitive information is 
		hashed. I will achieve this by taking help of various hashing algorithms.
		
	
	All these steps will make my API strong enough to face any data breach or attack from
	hackers.
